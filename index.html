          Hi! I'm Kyler Peterson. I'll probably be somewhere on a beach reading
          a book, playing volleyball, or enjoying the sun. Other wise I enjoy
          playing video, board, & card games, hangingout with friends, and my
          new nephew Marshall. I'm currently a student at the University of
          Utah, attending the online Coding Bootcamp Class. By the end I hope to
          be proficent in items Html, CSS and Javascript to name a few.

      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently still growing my project portfolio as I am relatively new
        to coding. However, I have been able to do one project<a
          href="https://github.com/Kpeterson23/Heroiseo/blob/main/index.html"
          >Heroiseo project</a
        >
        to improve the code while keeping the integrity and purpose of the
        original code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just finished this E-commerece Website. Allowing users to select an
        item of clothing<a href="https://code-crusaders.herokuapp.com/"
          >Code Crusaders Apparel</a
        >
        designed for the stay at home coders who need a comfy set of clothes to
        work in.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was my last project for my coding course through the University of
        Utah. We designed and created an app for teachers, allowing them to keep
        track of their students. Its called
        <a href="https://project-homeroom-89dc042d8908.herokuapp.com/"
          >Homeroom</a
        >
        a very simple but effective app that could be implemented into schools
        throught the states with the proper work!
