# Kyler's Future CSS Portfolio

Made from scartch CSS Work Portfolio. Made to use in the future of my career as a coder and developer.

# Description

The purpose of this Portfolio is showcase and present the skills I have learned a coder/developer thus far. I don't have all the projects done I will be updating this periodically with my new projects.

# Features

I started off with a basic HTML skeleton. Started filling it out corresponding to CSS. I then realized it was much easier for me to insert all of the HTML elements, sections, links, etc.
